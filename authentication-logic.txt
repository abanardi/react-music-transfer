This is going to be a guide on how exactly to 
authenticate the user

Steps:
    1. Start up the app
    2. Click a button to navigate to Spotify login
        2a. This will then return us to the React app
    3. We then either do one of the two
        3a. Make the user click a button to get the
            access token
        3b. We automatically call a function (ie. useEffect)
            so that it automatically creates the access token
    4. Now we have been authenticated and can access the 
        full Spotify api

Need to figure out:
    1. How to pass parameters into the functions with link parameters
    2. How to get the Apple Music API to work
    3. Does the Apple Music API have the same bullshit that the spotify
        one does?
